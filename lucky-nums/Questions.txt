Why does Insomnia give me this response...
{
  "text": "89 is the atomic number of actinium.",
  "number": 89,
  "found": true,
  "type": "trivia"
}

But resquests.get() gives me a response object that is totally different?
    I can't use resp.json()

Is there a way to refactor def make_error_dict(request): ?
